A simple page for the Little Lemon Restaurant using HTML and CSS

It is my second project throughout the entire path of my development in a front-end realm. I am expected to create a simple, but nice, web-page for the Little Lemon Restaurant (an idea of Coursera), using my gained HTML and CSS skills. I amexpected to use such CSS items as grid or flexbox. Working with box model, animations, styling etc. Meta tags and semantic tags should be included, as well. I decided to create this repo in order to see the efficency of the gained skils.
